JS Doc is a documentation syntax used to add comments directly into JavaScript code, which helps generate API documentation and provides type hints for IDEs and tools like TypeScript.

# Observations

- Adding `@ts-check` at the top of a file makes JSDoc much more helpful while developing. It shows errors in the code while writing, making it easier to fix them.
